description: >- 
  A tool for modular formal verification of correctness properties of single-threaded and multithreaded 
  C and Java programs annotated with preconditions and postconditions written in separation logic. 
  To express rich specifications, the programmer can define inductive datatypes, 
  primitive recursive pure functions over these datatypes, and abstract separation logic predicates.
