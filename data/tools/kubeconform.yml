  A fast Kubernetes manifests validator with support for custom resources.

  It is inspired by, contains code from and is designed to stay close to [Kubeval](https://analysis-tools.dev/tool/kubeval),
  but with the following improvements:
  * high performance: will validate & download manifests over multiple routines, caching downloaded files in memory
  * configurable list of remote, or local schemas locations, enabling validating Kubernetes custom resources (CRDs) and offline validation capabilities
  * uses by default a self-updating fork of the schemas registry maintained by the kubernetes-json-schema project - which guarantees up-to-date schemas for all recent versions of Kubernetes.
