description: >-
  Exhaustive detection of coding errors and their associated security vulnerabilities.
  This encompasses a sound undefined behavior detection (buffer overflows,
  out-of-bounds array accesses, null-pointer dereferences, use-after-free, divide-by-zeros,
  uninitialized memory accesses, signed overflows, invalid pointer arithmetic, etc.),
  data flow and control flow verification as well as full functional verification of formal
  specifications. All versions of C up to C18 and C++ up to C++20 are supported.
  TrustInSoft Analyzer will acquire ISO 26262 qualification in Q2'2023 (TCL3).
  A MISRA C checker is also bundled.
