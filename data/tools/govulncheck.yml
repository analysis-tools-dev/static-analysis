description: >-
  Govulncheck reports known vulnerabilities that affect Go code. 
  It uses static analysis of source code or a binary's symbol table to narrow down reports to only those that could affect the application.

  By default, govulncheck makes requests to the Go vulnerability database at https://vuln.go.dev.
  Requests to the vulnerability database contain only module paths, not code or other properties of your program.
