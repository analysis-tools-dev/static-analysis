  Enables code auditors and security teams to interactively investigate their unique
  code bases  to find business logic flaws and technical vulnerabilities that traditional
  SASTs cannot. This is done by enabling the analyst to write their own custom queries.
  Can find hard-coded secrets, authentication issues, and malicious code like rootkits
  and backdoors.
