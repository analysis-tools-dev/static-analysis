  Credential Digger is a GitHub scanning tool that identifies hardcoded credentials (Passwords, API Keys, Secret Keys, Tokens, personal information, etc), 
  and filtering the false positive data through a machine learning model called [Password Model](https://huggingface.co/SAPOSS/password-model). This scanner
  is able to detect passwords and non structured tokens with a low false positive rate.
