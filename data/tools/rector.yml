description: >-
    Instant Upgrades and Automated Refactoring of any PHP 5.3+ code.
    It upgrades your code for PHP 7.4, 8.0 and beyond.
    Rector promises a low false-positive rate because it looks for narrowly
    defined AST (abstract syntax tree) patterns. 
    The main use-case are tackling technical debt in your legacy code and removing dead code.
    Rector provides a set of special rules for Symfony, Doctrine, PHPUnit, and many more.
