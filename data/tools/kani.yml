  The Kani Rust Verifier is a bit-precise model checker for Rust. 
  Kani is particularly useful for verifying unsafe code blocks in Rust, 
  where the "unsafe superpowers" are unchecked by the compiler.
  Kani verifies:

  * Memory safety (e.g., null pointer dereferences)
  * User-specified assertions (i.e., assert!(...))
  * The absence of panics (e.g., unwrap() on None values)
  * The absence of some types of unexpected behavior (e.g., arithmetic overflows)
