description: >-
  A JavaScript compiler and TypeScript checker written in Rust with a focus on
  static analysis and runtime performance. Ezno's type checker is built from
  scratch. 
  The checker is fully compatible with TypeScript type annotations and can work
  without any type annotations at all.
