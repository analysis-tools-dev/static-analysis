  A formatter for Python files created by Google

  YAPF follows a distinctive methodology, originating from the 'clang-format' tool
  created by Daniel Jasper. Essentially, the program reframes the code to the most
  suitable formatting that abides by the style guide, even if the original code
  already follows the style guide. This concept is similar to the Go programming
  language's 'gofmt' tool, which aims to put an end to debates about formatting by
  having the entire codebase of a project pass through YAPF whenever changes are
  made, thereby maintaining a consistent style throughout the project and
  eliminating the need to argue about style in every code review.
