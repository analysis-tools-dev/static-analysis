  Packj (pronounced package) is a command line (CLI) tool to vet open-source software packages for "risky" attributes
  that make them vulnerable to supply chain attacks. This is the tool behind our large-scale security analysis
  platform Packj.dev that continuously vets packages and provides free reports.
