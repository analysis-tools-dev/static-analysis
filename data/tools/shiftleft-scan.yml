  Scan is a free open-source DevSecOps platform for detecting security issues in
  source code and dependencies. It supports a broad range of languages and CI/CD
  pipelines.
  Note: ShiftLeft rebranded to Qwiet AI in 2023, which was subsequently acquired
  by Harness in September 2025. This open-source project is no longer maintained.
