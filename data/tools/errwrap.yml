  Wrap and fix Go errors with the new %w verb directive. 
  This tool analyzes fmt.Errorf() calls and reports calls that contain a verb directive that 
  is different than the new %w verb directive introduced in Go v1.13. 
  It's also capable of rewriting calls to use the new %w wrap verb directive.
