  Perltidy is a Perl script which indents and reformats Perl scripts to make
  them easier to read. 

  The formatting can be controlled with command line parameters. The default
  parameter settings approximately follow the suggestions in the Perl Style
  Guide. 

  Besides reformatting scripts, Perltidy can be a great help in tracking down
  errors with missing or extra braces, parentheses, and square brackets because
  it is very good at localizing errors.
