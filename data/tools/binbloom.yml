description: >-
  The purpose of this project is to analyse a raw binary firmware 
  and determine automatically some of its features. 
  This tool is compatible with all architectures as basically, 
  it just does simple statistics on it.
  
  Loading address: binbloom can parse a raw binary firmware and determine its loading address.
  Endianness: binbloom can use heuristics to determine the endianness of a firmware.
  UDS Database: binbloom can parse a raw binary firmware and check if it contains an array containing UDS command IDs.
