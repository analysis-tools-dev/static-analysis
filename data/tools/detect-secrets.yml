    An enterprise friendly way of detecting and preventing secrets in code.
    
    It does this by running periodic diff outputs against heuristically crafted regex statements, 
    to identify whether any new secret has been committed. This way, it avoids the overhead of digging 
    through all git history, as well as the need to scan the entire repository every time.
