  Inspects tar archives and tries to spot portability issues in regard 
  to POSIX 2017 pax specification and common tar implementations.
  
  This project is intended to be used by maintainers of projects who want to offer portable source code archives for as many systems as possible.
  Checking tar archives with alquitran before publishing them should help spotting issues before they reach distributors and users.
