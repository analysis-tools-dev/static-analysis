description: >-
  Joern is a platform for analyzing source code, bytecode, and binary executables.
  It generates code property graphs (CPGs), a graph representation of code for cross-language code analysis.
  Code property graphs are stored in a custom graph database.
  This allows code to be mined using search queries formulated in a Scala-based domain-specific query language.
  Joern is developed with the goal of providing a useful tool for vulnerability discovery and research in static program analysis.
