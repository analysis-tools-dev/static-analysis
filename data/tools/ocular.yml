  Enables code auditors and security teams to interactively investigate their unique code bases 
  to find business logic flaws and technical vulnerabilities that traditional SASTs cannot.
  This is done by enabling the analyst to write their own custom queries.
  Can find hard-coded secrets, authentication issues, and malicious code like rootkits and backdoors.
