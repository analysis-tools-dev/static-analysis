description: >-
  Astrée automatically proves the absence of runtime errors and invalid con­current behavior in C/C++ applications.
  It is sound for floating-point computations, very fast, and exceptionally precise.
  The analyzer also checks for MISRA/CERT/CWE/Adaptive Autosar coding rules and supports qualification for ISO 26262,
  DO-178C level A, and other safety standards.
  Jenkins and Eclipse plugins are available.
