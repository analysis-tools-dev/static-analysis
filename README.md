# Awesome static analysis [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs (analysis performed on executing programs is known as dynamic analysis). — Definition by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis)

This is a collection of static analysis tools and code quality checkers for all programming languages.  
Explanation: [OSS] stands for Open-Source-Software, [PROPRIETARY] stands for proprietary software.
