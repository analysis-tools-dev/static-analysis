  Lizard is an extensible Cyclomatic Complexity Analyzer for many programming languages 
  including C/C++ (doesn't require all the header files or Java imports). 
  It also does copy-paste detection (code clone detection/code duplicate detection)
  and many other forms of static code analysis.
  Counts lines of code without comments, CCN (cyclomatic complexity number), token count of functions, parameter count of functions.
