description: >-
  A suite of tools for interactive program analysis with a focus on
  hunting for bugs in C and C++ code.
  MATE unifies application-specific and low-level vulnerability analysis using
  code property graphs (CPGs), enabling the discovery of highly
  application-specific vulnerabilities that depend on both implementation
  details and the high-level semantics of target C/C++ programs.
