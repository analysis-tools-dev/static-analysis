description: >-
  SonarQube for IDE (formerly SonarLint) is a free IDE extension available for IntelliJ, VS Code, Visual Studio, and Eclipse, 
  to find and fix coding issues in real-time, flagging issues as you code, just like a spell-checker. 
  More than a linter, it also delivers rich contextual guidance to help developers understand 
  why there is an issue, assess the risk, and educate them on how to fix it.
