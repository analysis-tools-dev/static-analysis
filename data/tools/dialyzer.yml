  The DIALYZER, a DIscrepancy AnaLYZer for ERlang programs.
  Dialyzer is a static analysis tool that identifies software discrepancies, 
  such as definite type errors, code that has become dead or unreachable 
  because of programming error, and unnecessary tests, 
  in single Erlang modules or entire (sets of) applications.

  Dialyzer starts its analysis from either debug-compiled BEAM bytecode 
  or from Erlang source code. The file and line number of a discrepancy 
  is reported along with an indication of what the discrepancy is about. 
  Dialyzer bases its analysis on the concept of success typings, 
  which allows for sound warnings (no false positives).
