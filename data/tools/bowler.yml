   Safe code refactoring for modern Python. 
   Bowler is a refactoring tool for manipulating Python at the syntax tree level. 
   It enables safe, large scale code modifications while guaranteeing that the 
   resulting code compiles and runs. It provides both a simple command line interface 
   and a fluent API in Python for generating complex code modifications in code.
