  The linter for vibe-coded apps. Catches hardcoded secrets, missing auth,
  hallucinated imports, SQL injection, and 48 other production bugs that AI
  coding tools consistently write. 52 rules across security, reliability,
  performance, and AI quality categories. Zero config, Babel AST-based
  analysis with regex fallback.
