description: >-
   chap analyzes un-instrumented ELF core files for leaks, memory growth, and corruption. 
   It is sufficiently reliable that it can be used in automation to catch leaks before 
   they are committed. As an interactive tool, it helps explain memory growth, 
   can identify some forms of corruption, and supplements a debugger 
   by giving the status of various memory locations.
