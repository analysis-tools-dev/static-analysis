  TSLint has been deprecated as of 2019. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/4534)
  for more details. `typescript-eslint` is now your best option for linting TypeScript.

  TSLint is an extensible static analysis tool that checks TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, 
  and functionality errors. It is widely supported across modern editors & build systems and can be customized 
  with your own lint rules, configurations, and formatters.
